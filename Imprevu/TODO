- Move Time in Evaluation
- Better names for TestState, TestIO
- HasEvents class necessary?

- In Happstack: factorize tests, servers
- getIntermediateResults seems to leak some internals. Anyway do we really need it?
- fix export lists: should we expect from users to look into Imprevu?

- Clean Tests
- rename "events"
- rename "RadioField" etc.
