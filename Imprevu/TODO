- Move Time in Evaluation
- Better names for TestState, TestIO
- HasEvents class necessary?

- In Happstack: factorize tests, servers
- getIntermediateResults seems to leak some internals. Anyway do we really need it?
- fix export lists: should we expect from users to look into Imprevu?

- Clean Tests
- rename "events"
- rename "RadioField" etc.
- Simplify "RuleEventInfo" ?

- Create master module "Imprevu.Happstack"
- same for Imprevu
- simplify EvalEnvN, EvalFunc, WebState

- factorize runEvalError/runEvaluate

Web:
- check Webstate/websession
