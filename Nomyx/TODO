
TODO list

Bugs:
- recurring event are making increasing memory size
- display bugs on MacOS (tabs, vertical size)
- online documentation not working with cabal install  --enable-documentation --haddock-hyperlink-source
- limit width collumn table
- fix facebook
- line separation code of the rule table

Improvements:
- make code instructions in the active rules table clickable to access haddock documentation
- refresh web page when new event (currently, player needs to hit F5)
- use TH in addRuleParams
- possibility to modify game details
- add examples with a game master, a castle..
- vote: include new players, delete leaving players 
- make settings file with start up rules (?)
- make/fix deployement: 
   - the interpreter needs GHC to be installed: is that right?
   - the Web application needs to access files from the library (Nomyx-Language)
   - the interpreter needs the library to be installed to read the modules
- rules should communicate by message passing instead of shared variable
- HCI improvements: space player names, bold games
- display viewer list
- some files are accepted when uploaded but cause the game to crash when restarting. Check with GATDs for example. 
- display vote infos (modalities, date etc.)
- parameterize the mail sender
- put a scroll on long IOs
- a way to overwrite uploads (automatically or with admin intervention)
- tag the save file with the version
- use a test suite instead of ad-hoc tests
- add a game number
- login with guest account
- clean after testing
- use deepseq


Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system
- first pass of compilation to check reference (avoid calls to non-existant variables for ex.)
- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- make a command line client
