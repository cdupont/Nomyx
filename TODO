
TODO list

Bugs:
- add global option to not send mails
- store hide/show status of divs
- forbid creating a player with same name
- where clauses are not accepted by the interpreter
- concurency access to Nomyx.save: can several happstack thread result in a file locked message?
- what if you activate again a rule already active? idem for deleted etc.
- why import prelude in the uploaded file?
- import StateT, <$> for rules
- set group rights when uploading file
- show code window should have a scroll bar

Improvements:
- make code instructions in the active rules table clickable to access haddock documentation
- option to read step by step the save file for analysis?
- refresh web page when new event (currently, player needs to hit F5)
- secure interpreter with mueval: time limits, no unsafe instructions, memory limits...
- add a name to events to be able to delete categories of them
- add "back to main page" links
- use TH in addRuleParams
- possibility to modify game details
- hide when no information
- cut rules too long
- purify some IO
- create an admin role
- add examples with a game master, a castle..
- add "delete game" for admin (+ del/add player, rule, event, variable?)
- fix facebook
- error messages: put line number + time
- vote: include new players, delete leaving players 
- log-in as another person


Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system
- first pass of compilation to check reference (avoid calls to non-existant variables for ex.)
- more stateless language
- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- make a command line client

Forum:
- start another VM to run Nomyx alone
