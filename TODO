
TODO list

Bugs:
- check when error on parameters (for victory for example)
- sendmail is blocking the game
- delete invalid events (in case of exception): events may be triggered twice if not deleted
- reading save file does not take absolute path
- add global option to not send mails
- empty game name
- store hide/show status of divs
- should be able to propose a rule in a game without viewing it
- an exception (for ex. in RuleProposed) can block the game
- forbid creating a player with same name
- where clauses are not accepted by the interpreter

Improvements:
- make code instructions in the active rules table clickable to access haddock documentation
- option to read step by step the save file for analysis?
- refresh web page when new event (currently, player needs to hit F5)
- input sanitization and error reporting
- secure interpreter with mueval: time limits, no unsafe instructions, memory limits...
- add a name to events to be able to delete categories of them
- add "back to main page" links
- recognize array vars to display them properly on HCI
- use TH in addRuleParams
- manage creation of game safely
- possibility to modify game details
- add a proper log system (with levels)
- hide when no information
- generate better messages for partial functions
- cut rules too long
- add help info about the meaning of view and join
- purify some IO
- create an admin role

Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system
- first pass of compilation to check reference (avoid calls to non-existant variables for ex.)
- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- make a command line client

Forum:
- start another VM to run Nomyx alone
