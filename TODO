
TODO list

Features to add:

- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- make a command line client
- make a session system
- colorize code
- make code instructions in the active rules table clickable to access haddock documentation


Improves:

- refresh web page when new event (currently, player needs to hit F5)
- input sanitization and error reporting
- avoid unrecoverable "error" in variables
- add tests in main Nomyx
- secure interpreter with mueval: time limits, no unsafe instructions, memory limits...
- add a name to events to be able to delete categories of them

Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system

BUGS
- fix moneyTransfer: accept new players, check balance is positive
- fix rule number for variables
- check when error on parameters (for victory for example)
- concurrent access to log file
- sendmail is blocking the game
- delete invalid events
