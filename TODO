
TODO list

Features to add:

- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- make a command line client
- make a session system with cookie
- make code instructions in the active rules table clickable to access haddock documentation
- option to read step by step the save file for analysis

Improves:

- refresh web page when new event (currently, player needs to hit F5)
- input sanitization and error reporting
- secure interpreter with mueval: time limits, no unsafe instructions, memory limits...
- add a name to events to be able to delete categories of them
- add "back to main page" links
- recognize array vars to display them properly on HCI
- do the export file
- use TH in addRuleParams
- manage creation of game safely
- warn when password false
- possibility to modify game details
- suppress "delRule"
- remove references to "multi" to improve flow
- add a proper log system
- change vocabulary: join,subscribing -> view, join

Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system

BUGS
- fix rule number for variables
- check when error on parameters (for victory for example)
- sendmail is blocking the game
- delete invalid events
- events may be triggered twice if not deleted (in case of exception)
- reading save file does not take absolute path
- accept line returns in the "code of the rule" column, in the mails also
- all players need to cast their vote, even if quorum is already reached
- don't send a mail when replaying a game with -r (?)
- empty login/password and game name
