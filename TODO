
TODO list

Bugs:
- check when error on parameters (for victory for example)
- reading save file does not take absolute path
- add global option to not send mails
- store hide/show status of divs
- forbid creating a player with same name
- where clauses are not accepted by the interpreter
- suppress player from game when logout (?)
- better manage event deletion: an event can be deleted twice using its number

Improvements:
- make code instructions in the active rules table clickable to access haddock documentation
- option to read step by step the save file for analysis?
- refresh web page when new event (currently, player needs to hit F5)
- secure interpreter with mueval: time limits, no unsafe instructions, memory limits...
- add a name to events to be able to delete categories of them
- add "back to main page" links
- recognize array vars to display them properly on HCI
- use TH in addRuleParams
- possibility to modify game details
- add a proper log system (with levels)
- hide when no information
- cut rules too long
- purify some IO
- create an admin role
- add examples with a game master, a castle..
- add "delete game" for admin (+ del/add player, rule, event, variable?)
- fix facebook
- de-mangle error messages, put line number
- add an input: button
- vote: include new players, delete leaving players 

Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system
- first pass of compilation to check reference (avoid calls to non-existant variables for ex.)
- more stateless language
- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- make a command line client

Forum:
- start another VM to run Nomyx alone
