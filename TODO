
TODO list

Features to add:

- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- implement Ctrl-C to quit program: rehook signal handlers
- show details of rules
- store state in DB
- make a command line client
- read/write .hs files
- make a clear login/session system

Improves:

- headers with revision
- refresh web page when new event
- reshape tests and add new primitives
- keep the rule in the field if compile error

Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system



Difficulties
- splitting up the program
- reading GATDs
- really hard to track bug with an instance of Ord defined with ">"


BUGS
- suppress events in delRule
