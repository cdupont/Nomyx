
TODO list

Features to add:

- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- make a command line client
- make a session system with cookie
- make code instructions in the active rules table clickable to access haddock documentation
- option to read step by step the save file for analysis

Improves:

- refresh web page when new event (currently, player needs to hit F5)
- input sanitization and error reporting
- secure interpreter with mueval: time limits, no unsafe instructions, memory limits...
- add a name to events to be able to delete categories of them
- add "back to main page" links
- recognize array vars to display them properly on HCI
- do the export file
- use TH in addRuleParams
- manage creation of game safely
- warn when password false
- possibility to modify game details
- suppress "delRule"
- remove references to "multi" to improve flow
- add a proper log system (with levels)
- change vocabulary: join,subscribing -> view, join
- hide when no information
- generate better messages for partial functions

Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system

BUGS
- check when error on parameters (for victory for example)
- sendmail is blocking the game
- delete invalid events (in case of exception): events may be triggered twice if not deleted
- reading save file does not take absolute path
- add option to don't send mails
- empty login/password and game name
- players seems to be added twice
- store hide/show status of divs

Forum:
- start another VM to run Nomyx alone
