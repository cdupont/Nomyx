
TODO list

Features to add:

- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- make a command line client
- make a session system with cookie
- colorize code
- make code instructions in the active rules table clickable to access haddock documentation


Improves:

- refresh web page when new event (currently, player needs to hit F5)
- input sanitization and error reporting
- secure interpreter with mueval: time limits, no unsafe instructions, memory limits...
- add a name to events to be able to delete categories of them
- add "back to main page" links
- recognize array vars to display them properly on HCI
- add command to rm save file
- add command to load specific tests

Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system

BUGS
- fix moneyTransfer: accept new players, check balance is positive
- fix rule number for variables
- check when error on parameters (for victory for example)
- concurrent access to log file
- sendmail is blocking the game
- delete invalid events
- events may be triggered twice if not deleted
- don't send mail if rule broken
