
TODO list

Features to add:

- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- store state in DB
- make a command line client
- make a clear login/session system

Improves:

- refresh web page when new event (currently, player needs to hit F5)
- keep the rule in the field if compile error
- input sanitization and error reporting
- avoid unrecoverable "error" in variables
- add tests in main Nomyx
- secure interpreter with mueval: time limits, no unsafe instructions, memory limits...

Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system

BUGS
- fix moneyTransfer: accept new players, check balance is positive
- fix rule number for variables
- schedule: drop 1 is wrong, protect head
- time events: some events are triggered 2 times
- self proposed victory not working
