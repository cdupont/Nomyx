
TODO list

Bugs:
- command line arguments are ignored if there is a save file
- recurring event are making increasing memory size
- upload file seems broken
- forbid void names
- display bank accounts bug
- import qualified Data.Map and Control.Category (or hide conflicting functions)
- clean outputs of leaving players (?)
- spam problems

Improvements:
- make code instructions in the active rules table clickable to access haddock documentation
- option to read step by step the save file for analysis?
- refresh web page when new event (currently, player needs to hit F5)
- secure interpreter with mueval: time limits, no unsafe instructions, memory limits...
- add a name to events to be able to delete categories of them
- use TH in addRuleParams
- possibility to modify game details
- hide when no information
- cut rules too long
- add examples with a game master, a castle..
- fix facebook
- vote: include new players, delete leaving players 
- make settings file with start up rules
- make/fix deployement: 
   - the interpreter needs GHC to be installed: is that right?
   - the Web application needs to access files from the library (Nomyx-Language)
   - the interpreter needs the library to be installed to read the modules
- rules should communicate by message passing instead of shared variables
- start with default game
- display inputs for viewers
- HCI improvements: space player names, bold games, unbold description
- display viewer list
- import qualified uploads
- separate uploaded files visually
- remove system dependancy (linux)
- 15 characters max fir names
- export save file bundled with uploads
- display version number in advanced
- add a space before buttons (in HTML)
- check sematics of input buttons
- files uploaded can be accepted while when restarting the game not. Check with GATDs for example. 
- Nomyx -n shouldn't need the interpreter loaded
- open the agora as new window
- display vote infos (modalities, date etc.)

Futur Nomic:
- ability to analyse rules, proof system
- first pass of compilation to check reference (avoid calls to non-existant variables for ex.)
- more stateless language
- interpreter (like tryhaskell.org) on the web page to debug rules
- make a command line client

Forum:
- start another VM to run Nomyx alone
