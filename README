Nomyx
=========

A Nomic game in Haskell

Nomyx is a fabulous and strange game where you have the right to change the rules in the middle of the game!
In fact, changing the rules is the goal of the game. Changing a rule is considered as a move. Of course even that could be changed!
In this game, the player can enter new rules in a dedicated language, modify existing ones, thus changing completely the behaviour of the game.
The original (paper) game: www.nomic.net
